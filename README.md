# Simon

Simon is an electronic memory game that was invented by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, and was later manufactured and distributed by Milton Bradley (now owned by Hasbro). The game was released in 1978 and quickly became popular. Simon has been popular for decades, which is a fun and entertaining game that tests a player's memory and concentration skills.

The Simon game consists of a round plastic device with four large coloured buttons: red, blue, green, and yellow. Each button produces a different musical tone when pressed. The game has a built-in speaker that plays a series of random tones and lights up the corresponding buttons in a specific sequence. The player's objective is to replicate the sequence by pressing the buttons in the same order.

The game starts with a simple sequence of only one button, and as the player successfully repeats each sequence, the game progressively becomes more challenging by adding one more step to the sequence. The game continues until the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button or pressing the buttons out of order.
